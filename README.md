# car-configurator

My repo for a car configurator, part of the technical assessment of the Mastered Bootcamp. [Check it out here!](https://car-configurator-4e6b9.web.app/)

## Project description

A car configurator using React Three.js, React Three Fiber & Drei, with the ability to select between two cars, change colours and add an accessory. The car configurator has a pricing calculator, allowing the user to see how much their current options cost. The user can also click a button to list further details on the left side of the screen.

## Assumptions made about the task

- A colour option will change the entire colour of the car, not a specific part.
- The specifications and pricing do not have to be accurate.

## Installation

First, from your node terminal, run ```npm install``` to install all necessary packages. Afterwards, run ```npm run dev```. This runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.
